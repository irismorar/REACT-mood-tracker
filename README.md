# REACT-mood-tracker
You need to build a simple Mood Tracker app where users can select their mood for the day from a set of predefined moods. The app should allow users to:

1. Select a mood from a list of moods (e.g., Happy, Sad, Excited, Tired, etc.).
2. Add the selected mood to a daily log (stored in an array using useState).
3. Display the list of logged moods with the date when they were recorded.
4. Persist the mood for the day (if a user tries to add another mood for the same day, prevent it and show an alert).
5. Clear the mood log with a button.
